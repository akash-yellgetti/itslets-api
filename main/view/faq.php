			<strong>How many dates will I get at a Www.itslets.com event?</strong>
			<br/>It can be anything up to twenty-five dates depending on the area - anything more than this just leads to confusion and further indecision, as well as being quite tiring.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Is three minutes long enough?</strong>
			<br/>No-one's expecting you to make a lifelong commitment on the basis of a speed date! Three minutes is long enough to decide whether or not you like someone enough to want to see them again, and ensures that embarrassing silences are kept to a minimum.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>What if I don't want to pay by credit card?</strong>
			<br/>For alternative methods of payment please call us on +917506946448. Please do not send cheques or postal orders.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Are there any specific requirements to sign up?</strong>
			<br/>You just need to be over 18 years old.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Can I go to more that one Www.itslets.com event?</strong>
			<br/>You can go to as many as you like. Most people at each event will be new to speed dating so it will give you more chances to meet the right person.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Can I bring a friend?</strong>

			<strong>How long does a Www.itslets.com event last?</strong>
			<br/>Including breaks the event may last up to three hours depending on the number of participants. Many speed daters stay for a few drinks after the event too.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>What happens when I arrive at the event?</strong>
			<br/>When you arrive you will be given a scorecard, a nametag and a pen, and the Www.itslets.com compere will explain how speed dating works and answer any questions. Then the dating begins. Usually women will stay seated while men will rotate every 3-5 minutes when the whistle blows. After each date participants mark on a scorecard whether they would like to see that person again. At the end of the evening we collect in the top-sheets of all scorecards.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>How old are the other speed daters?</strong>
			<br/>The other speed daters should be within the age groups specified.

			<br/><br/>
			<strong>What sort of people go speed dating?</strong>
			<br/>Most speed daters are professionals who want to meet more people. They're generally normal, attractive people who just aren't meeting people through their work or immediate circle of friends. www.itslets.com helps you connect through similar hobbies and like mindedness
